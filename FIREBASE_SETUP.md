# Firebase Email/Password Authentication Setup

## Important: Enable Email/Password Authentication

Your Firebase project needs email/password authentication enabled in the Firebase Console.

### Steps to Enable Email/Password Authentication:

1. Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project: `aipronunciationcorrector`
3. In the left sidebar, click on "Authentication"
4. Click on the "Sign-in method" tab
5. Find "Email/password" in the list of providers
6. Click on it and toggle "Enable" to ON
7. Click "Save"

### Current Issue:
The authentication forms are ready to work, but Firebase is returning authentication errors because email/password sign-in is not enabled in the console.

### Once Enabled:
- Signup form will create new users with email/password
- Login form will authenticate existing users
- User data will automatically sync to Firestore
- All form validation and error handling is already implemented

### Environment Variables Confirmed:
✓ Firebase API Key is set
✓ Firebase Project ID is set  
✓ Firebase App ID is set
✓ Firebase Auth Domain is configured

The app is ready to work as soon as email/password authentication is enabled in the Firebase Console.
